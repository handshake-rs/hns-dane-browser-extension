# Production Readiness Audit

Last audited: 2026-07-16

This audit treats the repository as a candidate update to an existing public Google Play app, not as a first closed-testing launch. The live listing observed during the prior audit served version `0.3.1` (`versionCode 22`), while the current repository release candidate declares Android `0.5.0` (`versionCode 40`) with shared Rust engine `0.5.0`. Local and signed-artifact verification is complete; hosted CI and exact-build release-device verification remain pending. Results and hashes retained for `0.4.1` are explicitly historical and do not establish readiness for `0.5.0`.

> Historical mobile audit only. Android is excluded from this extraction's
> workspace and release graph. Its recorded requester-default-on behavior is
> superseded by the current policy: browser requester use is opt-in, opaque P2P
> relaying is default-on with opt-out, and output-node service is separately
> opt-in. Use the canonical mobile repository for current readiness evidence.

## Release Candidate Findings

| Area | Status | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android release build | Locally verified for `0.5.0` | The clean committed-tree code 40 APK and AAB are non-debuggable, minified, resource-shrunk, and upload-signed. The APK SHA-256 is `bff5ba468b0c5ad2d134603127f089ad6fdc9e9b5ceab921825e570cfefd60fb`; the AAB SHA-256 is `96c5926c559881ba74e380eea062dce3de6cefaf91d3753882e528cccc96e1d0`. |
| Public Play listing | Reconciliation required | Google Play already has a production listing at `0.3.1` (`versionCode 22`). Before the next update, reconcile the live privacy-policy field, Data safety answers, listing text, screenshots, and release notes with current behavior and the eventual release version. |
| Privacy policy | Historical evidence; superseded | This audit recorded a requester-default-on P2P relay. That default is no longer current; see the notice above and the current privacy policy. |
| Manifest exposure | Ready | The only app-defined exported entry point is `LauncherActivity`. Browser, settings, diagnostics, HNS inspector, history, download, and other app activities are non-exported, and the app declares no service. Merged dependency components remain subject to their own signature/permission guards. |
| Backup / transfer | Ready | App backup and device-transfer extraction are disabled for local browsing data, WebView state, download records, diagnostics, resolver cache, and HNS sync/cache state. |
| Cleartext policy | Ready | Cleartext is disabled globally with a loopback-only exception for the local gateway. User-selected HTTP and direct DNS/HNS traffic are accurately disclosed, but ordinary open-web and user-initiated transfers are outside Google Play's Data safety collection/sharing scope. |
| WebView hardening | Ready | Mixed content is blocked, Safe Browsing is enabled, file/content access is disabled, native JavaScript bridges are removed, WebView debugging follows `BuildConfig.DEBUG`, and loopback proxying is limited to active HNS host/subdomain scope. |
| Privacy controls | Improved | Settings can clear cookies plus WebView origin storage, and the diagnostics UI can clear the bounded gateway event log. The repository and in-app disclosures now describe WebView-provider Safe Browsing and these local retention controls. |
| Build supply chain | Local gates pass; hosted gates pending | `scripts/check.sh`, 192 Android unit tests, debug/release lint, clean signed builds, and the relay fast/load/full acceptance tiers pass. Hosted path-policy, Rust, cold-cache Android, Apple, and required-result jobs remain pending for the exact candidate commits. |
| 16 KiB / native symbols | Ready locally for `0.5.0` | Both rebuilt JNI libraries passed PT_LOAD alignment, hardening, stripping, Build ID, matching FULL debug metadata, and path-sanitization checks; the signed APK also passed `zipalign -c -P 16 4`. |
| Release-device acceptance | Historical; not a current gate | The former code 40 checklist included first-run requester-on behavior. It is retained only as historical evidence and must not be used for the current opt-in requester policy. |
| Data collection posture | Repository review updated; live-form reconciliation required | No ads, analytics SDKs, developer accounts, sensitive permissions, advertising ID access, or developer telemetry endpoint was found. The policy now records that a relay peer receives the DNS name/type and source network address needed for the request. Retain the live `No collected / No shared` posture only after reconciling the current Play definitions and WebView-provider Safe Browsing guidance. |

## Applied Cleanup

- Added user-facing deletion of both cookies and WebView origin storage instead of clearing cookies alone.
- Replaced the automatic developer-hosted default homepage request with a bundled, Content-Security-Policy-restricted start page that contains no network resources and does not contact a Denuo Web server; configured remote homepages remain user-controlled.
- Added a Diagnostics control that clears the bounded, sanitized gateway event log.
- Updated the repository privacy policy to disclose WebView-provider Safe Browsing, WebView origin storage, and gateway-diagnostic retention/deletion.
- Corrected the Data safety draft to apply Google's explicit open-web, on-device, and user-initiated-transfer exclusions instead of treating ordinary browser networking as developer collection or sharing.
- Removed stale localized overrides for recently changed privacy and resolver-trace copy so affected locales fall back to the current, accurate source strings until translations are refreshed.
- Added deterministic in-app notices for the complete locked Android release-runtime and shipping Rust dependency inventories, with full license text and a CI-safe integrity check.
- Reworked release native packaging so AGP strips the installed libraries and embeds matching FULL debug metadata, while deterministic prefix maps keep checkout, home, Cargo, Rustup, and NDK paths out of both artifacts.
- Added an automated release-bundle gate for exact ABI inventory, 16 KiB bundle and ELF alignment, ELF architecture/type/bounds, native hardening, stripping, matching Build IDs and symbols, local-path rejection, R8 mapping, third-party notices, and upload signing.
- Hardened the loopback gateway so WebView proxy override is refused without reverse-bypass host scoping, non-HNS proxy traffic fails closed, and active HNS host/subdomain scope is enforced at the server.
- Added proof-pinned authoritative DoH bootstrap for single-label HNS endpoint names, with authoritative DoH preferred when declared, direct authoritative UDP/TCP 53 next, and the configured third-party HNS DoH resolver as the compatibility fallback. The browser now exposes the successful path explicitly in the status bar and strips its internal provenance header before content reaches Chromium or the page.
- Historical candidate: added an untrusted HNS P2P DNS requester after local proof and authoritative transport attempts, with requester use then enabled by default. That default is superseded by explicit requester opt-in.
- Current serving policy separates default-on/opt-out opaque relaying from the independently opt-in output-node role.
- Updated repository privacy and store disclosures for relay-visible queried names/types and client network address. The hosted privacy page must be updated before release.
- Updated `androidx.activity:activity-ktx` from an alpha build to stable `1.13.0`.
- Added local dependency, test, lint, bundle-signing, and supply-chain verification, with immutable Action references in the checked-in workflow.

## Remaining Release Gates

1. Run the hosted path-policy, Rust, cold-cache Android, Apple, and required-result jobs on the exact candidate commit. If future merges should require CI, leave GitHub Actions enabled and add appropriate protection or a ruleset for `main`.
2. Compare upload certificate SHA-256 `D2:2F:F3:25:17:53:11:EB:E6:D6:E9:3D:A3:FD:F5:1D:84:89:22:A1:B8:1A:CB:B3:2F:22:39:CC:F9:4A:51:14` with the upload certificate shown in Play Console.
3. Superseded mobile gate: repeat qualification in the canonical mobile repository using requester opt-in, opaque-relayer opt-out, and separate output-node opt-in controls.
4. Publish the revised privacy policy and reconcile the existing live Play listing: update its privacy-policy field, Data safety/app-access/content/ads answers, listing copy, release notes, and stale screenshots before submitting the verified AAB.

## Candidate Verification Status

- `0.5.0` / code 40 local checks: passed.
- `0.5.0` hosted CI checks: pending.
- `0.5.0` signed APK/AAB verification and hashes: passed and recorded above.
- `0.5.0` exact signed-build physical-device acceptance: pending because the Pixel 9 physically disconnected before installation.

## Historical `0.4.1` Evidence

- `./scripts/check.sh` passed on 2026-07-15 for Android `0.4.1` with shared Rust engine `0.4.0`, including supply-chain/version checks, formatting, warning-denied Clippy, all three cargo-deny scopes, the complete Rust test matrix, fuzz-target compilation, and the snapshot exporter.
- The final signed Android build passed with Gradle 9.6.1 / AGP 9.2.1, compile/target SDK 37, NDK `28.2.13676358`, and build-tools AAPT2 36.1.0; the clean gate completed 97 actionable tasks in 11m 13s after compiling both native ABIs.
- Android tests and lint reported 187 unit tests passed and no debug or release lint errors.
- Both packaged libraries reported NDK r28c, Android API 34, stripped status, 16 KiB PT_LOAD alignment, GNU_RELRO, non-executable GNU_STACK, BIND_NOW/NOW, and matching unstripped debug-symbol Build IDs. The signed release APK also passed `zipalign -c -P 16 4`.
- The final signed `0.4.1` / code 39 AAB SHA-256 was `4b2cc8b1da7700675eedb1ed2319ccafd9541acc7114abff9bd60eb6399b4267`. The signed GitHub APK SHA-256 was `a5a9d50d5b19302af488f7f5e6c68281364070edc7edcb14e16dbb1e1a5d61a2`; it matched the established release signer and passed APK Signature Scheme v2 plus 16 KiB ZIP-alignment verification.

## Watch Items

- Sync runs while any app activity is started and stops when the entire app backgrounds; verify cross-screen continuity, interruption, and catch-up resume on the release device.
- Release AAB signing and Play upload remain secret-dependent external operations. CI should build and structurally verify an unsigned release bundle without receiving signing or Play credentials.
- General-purpose browsing can reach arbitrary third-party content; keep target audience and content rating conservative and consistent with the live listing.
- Re-review the accepted hosted policy, repository policy, in-app privacy copy, and live Data safety answers whenever a material networking, storage, diagnostics, or third-party-service behavior changes.
- The hosted policy accepted for the historical release is now materially less complete than the `0.5.0` repository disclosure and must be updated before submission.
